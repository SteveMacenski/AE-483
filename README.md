# AE-483

Code and files used in AE 483: Decision Algorithms at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Only programs shown are those generated in entirety or majority by myself. Therefore code belonging to TAs, the University, or Professors will not be uploaded- so some gaps may exist. 

The purpose of this course is to use control algorithms to control a quadcopter in a lab environment and derive the relavent state-space information from the kinematics and dynamics of the platform. A final project concludes the course to create an entire controller and communications system to use a quadcopter to complete a useful, real world, task or solve a problem.
