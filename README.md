The purpose of this course is to use control algorithms to control a quadcopter in a lab environment and derive the relavent state-space information from the kinematics and dynamics of the platform. A final project concludes the course to create an entire controller and communications system to use a quadcopter to complete a useful, real world, task or solve a problem.
